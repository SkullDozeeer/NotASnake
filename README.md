##  PSA on Versions:
Order of updates:
v1.0 - v1.1 - v1.2 - v1.2.1 - v1.3 (TheBigOne) - v2.0 - v2.1/2.2 - v2.3 - v2.4 - v2.5 - v2.6 ---

Versions 1.2.1 and under were only py files, loaded by having to launch them directly with lots of struggles. if somebody wants to compile them into .exe for availability, go for it, but dont expect me to do it (MAKE A PULL)    
since v1.3 (The Big One) there are and source files AND .exe for debugging? dont just download the exe`s though - they dont include the libraries to play  

IF you compile an old version and make a pull request, please write me or something...
